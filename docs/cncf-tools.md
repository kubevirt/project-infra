# CNCF tools

We use several tools provided by CNCF, mainly netlify to manage the kubevirt.io
domain and several rooms in CNCF's slack, including [kubevirt-ci-monitoring].

In order to get access and configure these services you need to create tickets in
[CNCF's service desk]. These are the required steps to get access to this service
desk:

* Become a kubevirt maintainer:
  * Be included in the [list of maintainers in the community repo], see the
  [requirements to become a maintainer]
  * Be included in the [list of maintainers in the CNCF project maintainers list],
  basically propose a PR with the changes once the user is added to KubeVirt's
  community repo.
* Send an email to amye@linuxfoundation.org requesting access to [CNCF's service desk],
mentioning that the user is already listed in CNCF's maintainer list.

Once the access to the service desk is granted then the user can create tickets to
request access to the DNS tools for the KubeVirt domain, request changes in KubeVirt's
slack rooms or any other technical issue related to the services provided by CNCF.
