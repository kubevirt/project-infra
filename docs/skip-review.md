# Automating PR merges using the `skip-review` label

PRs generated by automation oftentimes are sufficiently validated if the presubmit
lanes succeed. In that case it is even cumbersome most of the time that a user has
to manually add the required labels in order to get the changes merged.

For these cases the label `skip-review` can be used to avoid burdening users with 
reviewing a generated pull request, instead advising tide to consider a PR good for
merge.

## How it works

The required parts are:
* existence of the label `skip-review` in the repository ([example k/kubevirt](https://github.com/kubevirt/project-infra/blob/ddedbb3162d9fd4400f9e373aaff8ca47aa1f621/github/ci/prow-deploy/kustom/base/configs/current/labels/labels.yaml#L533))
* existence of the [query configuration honoring the label `skip-review`](https://github.com/kubevirt/project-infra/blob/edce2a11c40963a3bb9f61f0765e1e48ba313de8/github/ci/prow-deploy/kustom/base/configs/current/config/config.yaml#L234) for tide
* adding the label to a PR when creating it ([example](https://github.com/kubevirt/project-infra/blob/9581758004e25ca9cc575eea637e259a1c93b0e2/github/ci/prow-deploy/files/jobs/kubevirt/kubevirt/kubevirt-periodics.yaml#L640))
