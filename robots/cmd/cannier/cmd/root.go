The CANNIER method is a procedure that optimizes the re-running times to find flaky tests by seperating them into three sets:
* the likely flaky ones,
* the likely stable ones, and
* the unknown ones.

The latter set is the set of tests that needs to get re-run repeatedly thus to check whether they are flaky.`,
